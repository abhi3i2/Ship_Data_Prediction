## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) values for ships. The project involves data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for ship TEU values using relevant ship characteristics as features. The project consists of several main components:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** We begin by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and preprocessing the data to prepare it for modeling.

2. **Model Building:** We create predictive models using various algorithms and techniques, including linear regression and potentially more advanced models.

3. **Model Evaluation:** We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

4. **Model Optimization:** If necessary, we optimize the model to improve its predictive accuracy.

5. **Documentation:** We document the code and results to provide transparency and reproducibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- R
- Required R packages (mentioned in the code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ship-teu-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd ship-teu-prediction
   ```

3. Run the R scripts provided in the repository to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Usage

To use the predictive model for your own data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset with the same columns as the sample dataset used in this project.

2. Load the trained model (if available) or train a new model using the provided code.

3. Use the model to make predictions on your dataset.

## Results

The main results of the project are summarized in the README or in a separate document. This section should include key findings and model performance metrics.
